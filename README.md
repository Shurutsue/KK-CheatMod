# KK-CheatMod
Cheat mod for KoboldKare. Still a mess, but I am learning.

To use the project yourself, you'll have to copy 3 files from KoboldKare_Data/Managed:
Assembly-CSharp.dll
PhotonRealtime.dll
PhotonUnityNetworking.dll

Shove them into the Libs folder and add as dependency in Visual Studio (if not already present)

## Installing BepInEx and getting the unstripped DLL's

W.I.P.
